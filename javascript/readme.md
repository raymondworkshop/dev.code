#### notes  
* JS Function is a value **representing an "action"**  

* object is stored and copied "by **reference**",
while primitive values: strings, numbers, booleans, etc are copied "as a whole value"  

* class  
    - in JS, a class is a kind of function  
    - a class is an **extensible program-code-template** for creating objects,
    providing init values for state (variables) and implementations of behavior (functions)
